HackNTrain
==========

trainz n stuff

We were inspired by the following video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86PUB4u2s2A, and decided to make a train style hack.

We bought a train set, an intell edison, and a bunch of tempreture sensors and melded them all together to make HackNtrain aka 2trainz.

The train sends its data to a http server which uses sockets to update a real time dashboard.

The hack won 8 breaker fall 2014 at HackNY fall 2014
